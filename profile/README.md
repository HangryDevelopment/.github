# Hangry (CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE ONLINE)
Hangry is a solo-project SPA that serves as a magic 8-ball for users to find a place to eat based on the entered location. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. The backend is built with Java using Spring Boot, Glitch, and the Yelp Fusion API.

(Unfortunately due to SSL issues the Hangry back-end is being hosted on glitch, the server takes some time to spin up.)
