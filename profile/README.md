# Hangry
Hangry is a solo-project SPA that serves as a magic 8-ball for users to find a place to eat based on the entered location. The frontend is built on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React. The backend is built on Spring Boot using AWS and the Yelp Fusion API.

(due to AWS fees and SSL issues Hangry will not actually work, if you'd like to see a working demo please let me know!)
