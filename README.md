# Hangry
Hangry is a personal project which will provide users with a randomly selected place to eat based on their location and some other parameters.

# Stories:
<ul>
<li>As a VISITOR I should see a landing page with a sign up option</li>
<li>As a USER I should see a welcome page with a basic control panel (option to find a place to eat, manage your favorites, see your previously visited places and orders)</li>
<li>As a USER I should be able to enter my location and receive a random place to eat</li>
<li>As a USER I should be able to add or remove places as favorites</li>
<li>As a USER I should be able to add or remove what I ordered / what I usually order at each place</li>
</ul>

# Features:
<ul>
<li>Very simple UI, gamified, almost like tinder but for fast-food.</li>
<li>Should see a map or some way to set your desired hangry search location</li>
<li>Should be able to insert location and receive random suggestion of places to eat</li>
<li>Will list x amount of places in x radius</li>
<li>Allow user to pick for themselves based on the 5-10 places, or to pick “decide for me”</li>
<li>Should be able to remove places from the fetched places permanently (I don’t like this place)</li>
<li>Should be able to set custom places (I can’t find my favorite place)</li>
<li>Based on the place randomly chosen, show menu, directions, app download with deals etc...</li>
</ul>

# Gamification:
<ul>
<li>Can only accrue points or streaks once a day</li>
<li>Food streaks for eating at the same place at least once a week (loyal)</li>
<li>Streaks for not eating at the same place in the same week (adventurous)</li>
<li>Could view other peoples orders “favorite order” and rate/rank them</li>
<li>Food challenge section for crazy orders</li>
</ul>
